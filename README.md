This is just the app's implementation, EquiDermAI's data augmentation (using CycleGAN) and tinyML pipeline is not present in this repo. Will be adding a new repo seperately with those elements of the pipeline

This is the iOS implementation for EquiDermAI, an AI tool to help individuals diagnose Mpox and Melanoma in resource constrained areas simply with a smartphone. 
Requires no internet connection, provides rapid diagnosis (latency of <1.7 seconds) and is completely private (on-device compute).
Helping those in need ❤️
